# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The Purpose of this analysis was to identify results
### Purpose
The Purpose of this analysis was to identify results
## Analysis and Challenges
To analyze the outcomes based on Goals, I created 8 new columns in a new sheet including, Goal, Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Cancelled, Total Projects, Percentage Successful, Percentage failed, and Percentage cancelled
To populate the new columns (Number Successful, Number Failed, Number Cancelled) COUNTIFS () Excel function was utilized with the SUM () Excel function being used to populate the relevant totals
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The following were the problems experienced while working on the project; I had a problem understanding how to use the “COUNTIF () Formular. I fixed the problem by asking the class instructor during office hours.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Campaigns Launched in the middle of the year have a high chance of being successful
There are generally no cancelled campaigns in October.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The percentage of successful projects is inversely proportional to the number of percentage failed projects except in the three instances when they are equal.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data set does not explain wholly what they mean by successful, failed, or canceled plays
-What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create
The data doesn’t explain what kind of plays are involved and that creating a bias in analysis
## Suggested Additional graphs
A graph showing success, failure, cancelation of plays by category
•	A pivot table with filters by amount and outcome
